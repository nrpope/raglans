This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Overview for Raglans Bistro

## Client Specifications

- menu with template for ease of updating
- online ordering redirect
- google maps pinned location
- hours
- contact information
- social media
- takeout menu pdf for printing/downloading/viewing

## Future Implementations

- delivery system
- paperless menu system
- email contact list for promotional materials

## Project goals

To make a simple, easily navigatible website for Raglans Bistro, that has a modular layout that will be easily updated for any future updates by the client. The menu should be clean and easily navigated either from desktop or mobile. The components will have blank templates that can be accessed by the client to make any nessicary changes.

Future goals include:

- a delivery system possibly tied into the online ordering sytem that is already in place with a set location restriction.

- a application for conctactless paperless menus activated by QRC or NFC tags placed on table, with a payment system added as an option

- email signup on the main page for sending promotional material

### Stack

Using React for frontend and later integration of rails for backend support
