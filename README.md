## Project goals

To make a simple, easily navigatible website for Raglans Bistro, that has a modular layout that will be easily updated for any future updates by the client. The menu should be clean and easily navigated either from desktop or mobile. The components will have blank templates that can be accessed by the client to make any nessicary changes.

Future goals include:

- a delivery system possibly tied into the online ordering sytem that is already in place with a set location restriction.

- a application for conctactless paperless menus activated by QRC or NFC tags placed on table, with a payment system added as an option

- email signup on the main page for sending promotional material
